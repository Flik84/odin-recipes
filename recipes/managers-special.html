    <h1>Old Spaghetti Factory Manager's Special</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Old Spaghetti Factory Manager’s Special dish is a family favorite, both to eat at home and to order at the restaurant. 
       It’s a classic! The Manager’s Special is half meat sauce and half mizithra with browned butter!
       Make this recipe at home in no time at all! Let me show you how!</p>
    <p>For the meat sauce portion of the recipe, I typically keep things simple. I honestly will brown up some ground beef or 
       ground turkey in a skillet with olive oil and garlic. Then, when the meat is cooked, I’ll just add a bottle of marinara 
       sauce on top. Since the browned butter has to be made from sratch, I typically just go for bottled sauce. 
       You can use any sauce you like!</p>
    <p>The browned butter portion of this recipe is exactly how it seems. You simply have to cook up some butter until it becomes golden brown. 
       You will place the butter into a saucepan and warm it on medium heat. It will take about 10 minutes, then it will begin to froth. 
       You will continue to cook the butter until it begins to brown, whisking repeatedly. Once it turns the shade of caramel 
       you will have browned butter.

    <p>Mizithra or myzithra is a fresh cheese made with milk and whey from sheep or goats, or both. The ratio of milk to whey usually is 7 to 3. 
       Production resembles that of Italian ricotta.</p>
